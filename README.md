# Raft-Consensus-Benchmark
Benchmarks the performance of multiple RAFT protocol implementations. Currently tests etcd-io/etcd (used by Kubernetes), HashiCorp Raft (used by Nomad and Consul), and tikv/raft-engine (used by TiDB). Other popular raft engines will be added soon.

## RAFT Implementations
